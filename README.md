# odin-sign-up-form

This project was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum, and the design was loosely based on this screenshot from the project description: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png

The product features an HTML form with simple input validations as well as styling using CSS pseudo-classes. It's also reasonably responsive, though the absolute positioning of the display image makes this project best for desktop viewing.

Tbh, this project has been my least favorite so far - the instructions specifically said not to worry about making it work for mobile, so I decided to implement what I recently learned about absolute positioning in the page design. I really enjoy making projects that are fully responsive though, so while this was good practice, the whole thing just feels a little "meh" to me. I don't think I stand much to gain by just continuing to re-style it though, and the form itself (as well as the rest of the page, I suppose, even if I wouldn't design something like this again) is functioning as I intended.

In the future I may add some JS to confirm that the passwords match, but that's all for now!
